## What actually is this ##
It's just a little game, which gets kind of boring after a few tries
## Requirements ##
This project is built on Python 3.6 and uses "tkinter", "time" and "random" libraries, all of these are usually installed during the installation of Python 3.6 and are necessary for this program to work. Also I'm pretty sure the "tkinter" library isn't natively supported by most Android devices

## Usage ##
I hope it is intuitive, but here you go:
#### When you're not the guesser => computer is guessing the number: ####
- computer generates a number
- you click a button with corresponding answer on it
- if you've made a mistake, it might end on a different number
#### When you're the guesser => you are guessing the number: ####
- you'll have to write an integer into the only text field availible
- press the "Submit guess" button or hit "Enter" on keyboard to try your guess
- in a pop-up window you'll be told whether the number you're looking for is lower or higher
- as this also trains memory you can't cheeck previous tries so remember them
- the "Give up" button will start a dialogue on whether you want to quit guessing
